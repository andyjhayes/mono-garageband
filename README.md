## Disclaimers ##

This is purely a homebrewed set of Monogram presets and MIDI/KBSC assignments for Apple GarageBand. A few things to keep in mind:

- It isn't developed or endorsed by either company. 
- It's provided with no warranty and it may not work on your system.
- Future GarageBand or Monogram updates might break it.
- It's licensed under <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a>. Pull requests and issues are welcome :)

### Known Limitations ###

- Some assignments depend on keyboard shortcuts and may not work with certain non-US/non-English localizations or non-QWERTY keyboard layouts.
- Workaround for above limitation: Please create custom key command assignments in Monogram Creator using the Customize > Keyboard Mode dialogue. For example, assign the Spacebar to a key/button in order to create a Play/Pause command.
